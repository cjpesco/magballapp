# magballapp

This is a boss level 1 task by brewery
so yes this is my solution to the task.
Magic 8 Ball.
In this project I separated the files like main, home, magballpage
So in main I just called MagBallApp class to build my ui
while in MagBallApp I also call the class MagBallPage to create
the dynamic page of the 8 ball so this is were my Stateful widget lives.

Tried to use a Column Widget but settle with a Center Widget
since this is a practice project I use a Container with Image Asset widget to be the child of Inkwell
to use the OnTap function.

A new Flutter project.
